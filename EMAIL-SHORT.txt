Subject: How I Built a Competitive Analysis Dashboard in 1 Hour Using AI 🚀

Hi Team,

I wanted to share how I used AI to build a comprehensive competitive analysis dashboard in about an hour. This demonstrates the power of AI-assisted development for business analysis.

🎯 THE CHALLENGE
Compare ServiceNow connectors (Glean vs Google vs Microsoft) and identify capability gaps for Microsoft.

💡 THE APPROACH
Used Claude Code (Anthropic's AI assistant) in a single conversation with natural language prompts.

📊 WHAT I BUILT
Live Dashboard: https://mayanksethi26.github.io/ServiceNow-Compete-analysis/

- Interactive visualizations (bar, radar, trend charts)
- 40+ features compared across 7 categories
- 8 prioritized gaps with HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW impact
- Historical tracking (auto-updates each visit)
- Source citations (hover over ⓘ icons)
- Fully responsive, modern UI

🚀 THE PROCESS (6 Steps in ~1 Hour)

Step 1: Initial Request
My prompt: "Compare Glean, Google, Microsoft ServiceNow connectors and highlight gaps"
Result: ✓ 40+ features analyzed, ✓ 8 gaps identified, ✓ Dashboard created

Step 2: Dashboard Creation
Result: ✓ HTML/CSS/JS with Chart.js, ✓ Dark theme, ✓ Interactive charts

Step 3: Historical Tracking
My prompt: "maintain a log of changes so when I launch next time..."
Result: ✓ Auto change detection, ✓ Historical snapshots, ✓ Trend visualization

Step 4: Making It Shareable
My prompt: "how can I make this site shareable with my manager"
Result: ✓ GitHub Pages deployed, ✓ Deployment guides, ✓ Email templates

Step 5: Source Citations
My prompt: "add hover icon with snippet of text from where conclusion was drawn"
Result: ✓ Interactive tooltips, ✓ Direct quotes, ✓ Verifiable sources

Step 6: Live Deployment
Result: ✓ Live at github.io, ✓ Auto-updates on git push

📈 THE NUMBERS
• Time: ~1 hour (vs 3-5 days traditional)
• Files: 15 files created
• Code: 3,359 lines
• Features: 40+ compared
• Sources: 3 official docs
• Commits: 2 git commits

🔑 KEY FINDINGS
1. Glean leads (82.5/100) with strong AI/automation
2. Microsoft scores 60.3/100 with critical gaps:
   - No AI agents (Glean shows 67% faster resolution)
   - Permission sync only on full crawls (23-hour lag)
   - Category-level permissions not supported
   - No ticket attachments/comments indexing
3. Google scores 53.8/100 but leads in real-time sync

💼 BUSINESS VALUE
✓ Faster insights (hours vs days)
✓ Visual and interactive
✓ Easy to share and update
✓ Verifiable with sources
✓ Historical tracking built-in

🎓 WHAT THIS DEMONSTRATES
• AI for research & analysis
• Production-ready code generation
• Modern UI/UX design
• DevOps & deployment
• Comprehensive documentation

All from natural language prompts!

GitHub: https://github.com/mayanksethi26/ServiceNow-Compete-analysis

Key Features to Explore:
- Interactive charts showing scores
- Gap analysis with priorities
- Detailed feature comparison (filterable)
- Hover over ⓘ icons for source citations
- Historical trends

💡 TAKEAWAYS
1. AI as force multiplier: Days → Hours
2. Natural language = Code (no dev skills needed)
3. Iterative refinement through conversation
4. Production-ready output with docs
5. Focus on analysis, not tooling

🤔 DOES THIS REPLACE HUMAN ANALYSIS?
No - it accelerates it. I provided strategic direction and reviewed outputs. AI handled research, coding, and deployment.

🚀 NEXT STEPS
- Monthly updates tracking Microsoft's progress
- Expand to Zendesk/Slack connectors
- Add customer benchmarking data
- Create executive presentation

The future of work isn't AI replacing humans—it's humans with AI replacing humans without AI. 🚀

Best,
